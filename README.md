# Plant-Disease-Classification-using-CNN-and-Tensorflow(COMPUTER VISION)
This project aims to classify diseases in potato plants using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The deep learning model is trained on a dataset of potato plant images to identify and categorize different diseases affecting the crops.


# Dataset from Kaggle 
#dowload : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadardiputra/potato-leaf-disease-dataset The dataset used for this project comprises high-resolution images of healthy and diseased potato plants. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the CNN model.
# Results 
97-98 percent accuracy obtained
